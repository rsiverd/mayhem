Prism:

vtx1 [collimator, top]: (-62.6152, 56, -615.298)
vtx2 [collimator, bot]: (--62.6739, -65.774, -614.866)


front face of prism is angled at 51.007 degrees relative to optical axis
front face of prism is angled by 27.5 degrees relative to front face of prism mount (half the 55 degree wedge angle, good!)

front and rear faces of prism mount are parallel
front edge of prism mount inclined 23.507 degrees w.r.t. front face of camera
rear edge of prism mount inclined 156.493 degrees w.r.t. front face of camera (same)

front edge of grating mount rotated 21.32 degrees w.r.t. rear face of prism mount
front edge of grating mount rotated 44.827 degrees w.r.t. optical axis
--> sanity check: 23.507 + 21.32 = 44.827

grating inclined 80.27 degrees w.r.t. optical axis
grating inclined 13.786 degrees w.r.t. optical bench
