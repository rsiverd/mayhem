The "mayhem" pipeline is a robust, fault-tolerant pipeline for calibration and
processing of NRES spectra. This software is meant to run automatically via
cron job and produce science-grade results to simplify a wide range of analysis
and engineering tasks. If it works as intended, this code can be run at ~any
time and will automatically update existing results as needed, eliminating the
risk of processing with incomplete data (results will auto-converge to best).

Features:
* building of master calibration files across multiple days (with barriers)
* automatic rebuilding of old/existing files with new methods or new data
* blind extraction and identification of spectroscopic orders and fibers!
