I do not yet implement anything that accounts for the index refraction of
air in the spectrograph. As this could affect a lot of things, it is probably
worth doing. In particular, should:
* Determine and document what kinds of wavelengths are present in the various
      line lists I use for reference.
* Determine what kind of wavelength is most appropriate for calibrating NRES
      (does it matter?).
