As of today (2019-02-12), the prism in the DoublePassPrismGratingPrism() model
only disperses and is limited operate exclusively in the plane parallel to the
optical bench and perpendicular to echelle dispersion. The prism has no effect
in the vertical (perpendicular to bench) direction; the path of light rays
in the dispersion direction ignores the prism. In reality, I suspect there
should be at LEAST a displacement along this axis (and maybe dispersion is
affected too, this is unclear) as the light ray passes through the prism.
Given that we use a dispersive prism, I suspect this displacement is wavelength
dependent. If true, this means the PRISM plays a role in the dispersion within
individual orders that should not be ignored.

Things to implement:
* vector form of Snell's law (see PDF in this folder and stackexchange link
   in the URL list)
* estimation of the vertical image displacement due to passage through prism
