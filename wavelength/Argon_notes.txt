Object identification in the 2D image is probably not a useful path. The
blooms have varying length and Argon spots in adjacent fibers can overlap,
making robust segmentation very hard. 

An alternative option may be to multiply the master flat and double, 
effectively "highlighting" the bits of Argon lines that land in the
expected locations. This might work.

Better course of action: look for saturated pixels after extracting.
